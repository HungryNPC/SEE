    <p class="content" style="font-size: 50px;"><strong>Greetings!</strong></p>
    <p class="content">- Thank you so much for considering using SEE?.</p>
    <p class="content">- This website is a team project made by two people.</p>
    <p class="content">- We chose this topic because Science is a really wild and amazing subject, but sadly there arent enough sites that provide both precise information examples along with images and videos for their users to work with.</p>
    <p class="content">- However this site of us can provide information for everyone including people who have no knowledge in it and the ones that are specialized in this subject already.</p>
    <p class="content">- And since we have added tons of images, videos and references, we believe that this will help with your researching alot.</p>
    <p class="content">- Finally, we wish that everyone using this site will have a good time and maybe will have a better understanding in Science afterwards.</p>
    <p class="content"><strong>Once again, thank you for choosng SEE?</strong></p>
